## Overview
The bot has several significant improvements.
1. Enhanced Process Visualization
   - Added detailed progress tracking for all functions
   - Implemented percentage display specifically for several functions
   - The progress message updates in real-time and disappears when processing is complete
2. Improved Scalability for Multiple Users
   - Completely rewrote the wallet processing logic to handle concurrent requests
   - Each user's request now runs independently in the background using asyncio tasks (Multiple users can now process wallets simultaneously without blocking each other)
3. API Rotation System
   - Implemented files with Quicknode and Helius API
   - Assigns endpoints in a round-robin fashion
   - Tracks which API endpoints each user is using
   - Rotates through available endpoints when a user makes multiple requests
